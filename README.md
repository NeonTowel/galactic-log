# Galactic Log

## Overview

**Galactic Log** is a cross-platform personal logbook designed for tracking work, thoughts, and context shifts. It operates fully offline, ensuring privacy through local encryption.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, execute `wails dev` in the project directory. This will start a development server for fast hot reload of frontend changes. For browser development with access to backend methods, connect to the dev server at http://localhost:34115.

## Building

To create a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
